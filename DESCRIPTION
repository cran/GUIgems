Description: A graphical user interface for the R package Gems.  
    Apart from the functionality of Gems package in the Graphical User interface, GUIgems
    allows adding states to a defined model, merging states for the analysis and plotting 
    progression paths between states based on the simulated cohort.
    There is also a module in the GUIgems which allows to compare costs and QALYs between different cohorts.
